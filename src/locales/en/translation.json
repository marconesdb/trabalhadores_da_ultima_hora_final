This motto is the celestial torch, the luminous column that guides man in the desert of life, leading him to the Promised Land.\" (...)",

      "paragrafo1": "In Montes Claros, MG, where the lights of hope shone on every corner, an extraordinary group called \"Workers of the Last Hour\" dedicated their hours to the noble mission of serving love and food to those most in need.",
      "paragrafo2": "On cold winter nights or hot summer evenings, they decided to bring comfort not only to empty stomachs, but also to afflicted hearts. Equipped with baskets full of nutritious snacks and homemade meals, the volunteers set out through the city streets in a humble van.",
      "paragrafo3": "Along the way, they met homeless people who, despite adversity, maintained grateful smiles. The Workers of the Last Hour offered them hot food, blankets and, most importantly, a human connection that transcended the barriers of indifference.",
      "paragrafo4": "The group extended their generosity to hospitals, where people anxiously awaited medical care. In busy waiting rooms, volunteers distributed comforting meals, providing momentary relief for those facing difficult times.",
      "paragrafo5": "Among the volunteers, there were collaborators with professional training from the most diverse areas, united by a common purpose: to be the light in the darkness of need. Their touching stories, prayers and encouraging words warmed the hearts of those waiting for food.",
      "paragrafo6": "On these memorable nights, they always found lonely and helpless women and men. In addition to feeding them, the Workers of the Last Hour offered them company and listened to their stories. The exchange of experiences brought comfort to both volunteers and those assisted, proving that the act of serving goes beyond simple feeding.",
      "paragrafo7": "At the end of the night, the Workers of the Last Hour not only fed hungry bodies, but also fed souls thirsty for compassion. Their commitment was a living testimony that, even in the last hours of the day, it is possible to illuminate lives and spread hope, a snack of love served with a touch of humanity."
